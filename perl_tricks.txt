To replace text in a set of files

perl -pi -e 's/"what youre lookin' for"/"replace with"/gi' "name of file/s"

So, to replace "cndlab" with "nmmlab" across a bunch of config file:

perl -pi -e 's/cndlab/nmmlab/gi' *

Now, to replace a heinous string like "</<" with </H3> in all .html files in
directory do the following...

perl -pi -e 's/<\/</<\/H3>/gi' *.html

Need to remove all those ^M characters from a DOS file? Try

        tr -d \\r < dosfile > newfile

Decode a base64 encoded file. Remove all headers and just act on the raw
encoding for this to work:

perl -MMIME::Base64 -ne 'print decode_base64($_)' < file.txt > out
