    With 6 groups, running out of memory when loading /etc/dynamips/l3-4-nat into dynagen (12.2 G out of 14 allocated for VM kills dynagen)
    Decision:

        run different configuration || 
    For less pods, we can use routers-5e.net or routers-6.net

        Verified addreses are correct, added a new group_host stanza to our rulest and,
        hopefully, made it more obvious that this is a group exercise.

        Removed the routers.db and /etc/mailname items as they are now clean and good. Kept the rancid
        jitter for cron job bit and updated all the hosts in the tables to be current. Added a title!

        Added a full LibreNMS Alert exercises. We have removed the section to copy
        over the default LibreNMS cron file to /etc/cron.d/librenms as this overwrites
        our perfectly staggered and simplified cron jobs for LibreNMS. This bit us pretty
        hard! :-)

        Minor tweak to make it clear where to add the CISCO MIBS statement in /etc/snmp/snmp.conf and as snmpd is partially installed on srv1.campusY noted you need to complete sections 3 and 7 to 7.1 for it to be functional (for snmp3) and to respond to queries.

        Taking a compromise path for now. We shall revisit this to finalize how we want to deal
        with localhost. Removed localhost references from the hostgroups file, but did not
        remote the device entry. Did not exclue the student's server from hostgroup entries. Also, changed the parent relationshiops that transitN.nren's parent is bdr1.campusY and bdr1.campusY has not parent as traffic flows to the Nagios instance from bdr1.
