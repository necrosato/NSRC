Note:
    When installing mysql-client and mysql-server, one is NOT asked to set a password for the root mysql user.
    Furthermore, when one attempts to log into mysql with -uroot and -p as sudo, the password will prompt but accept any input.
    On the contrary, when one attempts to log into mysql with -uroot and -p as sysadm, the password field will prompt but accept NO input.

Note:
    When attempting to create the libreNMS database, it appears that one already exists on srv1.campus1.ws.nsrc.org

Note:
    Even though I have followed the snmp excercise, I still had to add 'rocommunity NetManage' to /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf for srv1.campus1.ws.nsrc.org

Note:
    There is already a /opt/librnms folder; I am renaming it and recloning
    After recloning, git tag gives no output

Note:
    When attempting to run install.php
        Error: Missing dependencies, run: ./scripts/composer_wrapper.php install --no-dev
    After recloning, I had to run 
        # ./scripts/composer_wrapper.php install --no-dev
    before running the web installer
    
Note:
    When attempting to create the admin user from the web installer, it says that admin already exists. I used admin2.

Note:
    When verifying, there were many issues. I followed all suggestions from librenms to fix the errors, but I had to proceed with two unresolved:
    Unresolvable Issue 1:
        Fail: Database: missing index (config/uniqueindex_configname)
        Fail: We have detected that your database schema may be wrong, please report the following to us on IRC or the community site (https://t.libren.ms/5gscd):
        Fix: run te following SQL statements to fix.
            ALTER TABLE `config` ADD UNIQUE `uniqueindex_configname` (`config_name`);

        When running this I got:
            ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry 'alert.admins' for key 'uniqueindex_configname'

    Unresolvable Issue 2:
        Fail: fping6 should have CAP_NET_RAW capability (getcap) or suid. Selinux exclusions may be required. ((null): can't create raw socket (must run as root?) : Permission denied)
        Fail: fping6 should have CAP_NET_RAW!
        Fix: setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/bin/fping6

        When running this I got:
            Failed to set capabilities on file `/usr/bin/fping6' (Invalid argument)
            The value of the capability argument is not permitted for a file. Or the file is not a regular (non-symlink) file

Note:   
    When adding nets to librenms config, I believe that the net should be "172.Y.0.0/16", not "172.2Y.0.0/16"

Note:
    Could not create rule "Devices up/down"
    When attempting to import from "devices.status equal" I cannot leave the value field blank as instructed
