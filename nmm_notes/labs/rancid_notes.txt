Note:
    I was not able to simply
        $ apt-get install rancid
    I first had to 
        $ apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

Note:
    There are steps for creating a rancid user, but a rancid user already exists

Note:
    file /var/lib/rancid/.cloginrc did not previously exist.

Typo: Section 4.1
    We are adding three lines to the above file, not two

Note: 
    Not sure what XX is (server number?) in 
        bdr1.campusY(config)# interface LoopbackXX      (replace XX with your server number)
    I used 1, (bdr1)

Issue:
    Rancid cannot ssh into core1
