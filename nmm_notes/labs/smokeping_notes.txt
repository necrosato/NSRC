Note:
    I am assuming that on the second line, "connect to your PC" is referring to hostX.campusY.ws.nsrc.org

Note:
    Google.org should be google.com

Note:
    menu for facebook http remote should be Facebook, not Network Startup Resource Center

Note:
    s1.ws.nsrc.org failing DNS probe but dig returns.
