Decision:
    Retire hp-config-elements.ppt

ISSUE:
    Could not telnet into any devices to set up ssh, password not found in any md files.
        Resolution: look in /etc/dynamips/

    To ssh into dynamips images, first we must ssh into ubuntu@vtp.ws.nsrc.org, because we changed the ssh clients config (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)
