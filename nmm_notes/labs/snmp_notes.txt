NOTE:
    When attempting to configure snmp on routers and switches:
    When attempting to ssh into core1, dist1-b1, and dist1-b2:

        Unable to negotiate with 2001:db8:1::2 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

    Fixed by using the following ssh command:
        
        $ ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c 3des-cbc nmmlab@XXXX.campusY.ws.nsrc.org


Note:
    .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1 OID gives nothing for all devices
    .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1 OID gives nothing for all devices


TODO: Fix paths to mibs at www.ws.nsrc.org/

    For CISCO-ENVMON-MIB.my:
        $ sudo wget http://www.ws.nsrc.org/Campus\ Network\ Design\ \&\ Operations/CISCO-ENVMON-MIB.my

    CISCO-SMI.my does not exist on www.ws.nsrc.org in /var/www


TODO:    Typo in SNMPwalk - the rest of MIB-II
    "Try and run snmpwalk on any hosts (routers, switches, machines) you have not tried yet, in the 10.10.0.X network"
    The ip range is incorrect
