Note:
    "Log in to your virtual machine" is really "Log in to your lxd container"
    The container must be started before anything can be done, this is NOT the nmm vm.

Note:
    To log into containers:
        username: sysadm
        password: nsrc+ws
    To log into nagios:
        username: nagiosadmin
        password: nsrc+ws

TODO:
    "You may skip to step 3."
    There is no "step 3" this is meant to be the third command, 
        $ sudo systemctl enable apache2

Question:
    transit1 ssh seems to be down when monitoring ssh service
