Note:
    "Log in to your virtual machine" is really "Log in to your lxd container"
    The container must be started before anything can be done, this is NOT the nmm vm.

Note:
    To log into containers:
        username: sysadm
        password: nsrc+ws
    To log into nagios:
        username: nagiosadmin
        password: nsrc+ws

Note:
    on first apache2/nagios3 startup, do
    sudo systemctl enable apache2
    sudo systemctl enable nagios3
    to make the services restart when the container restarts

TODO:
    "You may skip to step 3."
    There is no "step 3" this is meant to be the third command, 
        $ sudo systemctl enable apache2

Question:
    transit1 ssh seems to be down when monitoring ssh service

Note:
    srv1.campus1 must be added to the http hostgroup in hostgroups_nagios2.cfg    

TODO:
    Need to explain how to add
'''
define hostgroup {
        hostgroup_name nagios-servers
                alias           NAGIOS
                members         localhost
        }
               
'''
    to /etc/nagios3/conf.d/hostgroups_nagios2.cfg in optional excercise XI for Nagios

    I do not know what the guide means in the last step by invoking:
        check_command               check_http_url_auth!/nagios3/!nagiosadmin:password
