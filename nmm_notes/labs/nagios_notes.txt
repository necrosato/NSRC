Note:
    "Log in to your virtual machine" is really "Log in to your lxd container"
    The container must be started before anything can be done, this is NOT the nmm vm.

Note:
    To log into containers:
        username: sysadm
        password: nsrc+ws
    To log into nagios:
        username: nagiosadmin
        password: nsrc+ws

Note:
    on first apache2/nagios3 startup, do
    sudo systemctl enable apache2
    sudo systemctl enable nagios3
    to make the services restart when the container restarts

TODO:
    "You may skip to step 3."
    There is no "step 3" this is meant to be the third command, 
        $ sudo systemctl enable apache2

Question:
    transit1 ssh seems to be down when monitoring ssh service

Note:
    srv1.campus1 must be added to the http hostgroup in hostgroups_nagios2.cfg    

TODO: OPTIONAL EXCERCISE XI
    Need to explain how to add
        '''
        define hostgroup {
                hostgroup_name nagios-servers
                        alias           NAGIOS
                        members         localhost
                }
                       
        '''
    to /etc/nagios3/conf.d/hostgroups_nagios2.cfg in optional excercise XI for Nagios
    (I'm not even sure the above is correct, the documentation does not exist expllicitly for section XI, aka the 'hints')
    "... and of course you'll need to create a hostgroup called nagios-servers to link to this service check. (hint, /etc/nagios3/conf.d/hostgroups_nagios2.cfg) "

    I do not know what the guide means in the last step by invoking:
        check_command               check_http_url_auth!/nagios3/!nagiosadmin:password

    where does one put
        '''
        define command{
                command_name    check_http_url_auth
                command_line    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_http -H '$HOSTADDRESS$' -u '$ARG1$' -a '$ARG2$'
                }
        '''

    In part 2:
        Incorrect hostnames for snmp-servers hostgroup


TODO:
    Disk space plugin:
        Need to specify where to put the service 
        '''

        define service {
                host_name                       noc
                service_description             Disk space /
                check_command                   check_hrstorage!NetManage!/!80!90
                use                             generic-service
                notification_interval           0
        }


        '''
        Should point to /etc/nagios3/conf.d/services_nagios2.cfg

Note:
    The Disk Space Plugin will not work until SNMP excercise has been completed, the steps are correct though
