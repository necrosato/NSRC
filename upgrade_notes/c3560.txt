Current image as of January 12th, 2018: c3560e-universalk9-mz.152-4.E5.bin

For installation of a new image from a working image:

    > en
    # conf t
    (config)# ip default-gateway 10.0.0.1
    (config)# int vlan 1
    (config-if)# ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
    (config-if)# no shut
    (config-if)# end
    # copy scp: flash:
        10.0.0.4
        pi
        /home/pi/c3560e-universalk9-mz.152-4.E5.bin
        c3560e-universalk9-mz.152-4.E5.bin
    # conf t
    (config)# no boot system
    (config)# boot system flash:c3560e-universalk9-mz.152-4.E5.bin
    (config)# end
    # wr memory
    # reload

        NOTE: Microcode must update the first time the switch boots with a new image. This takes 30-45 minutes and seems scary; never fear.

For installation of a new image from the ROMMON:

        To get into the ROMMON, follow the below instructions found at 
            https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-2950-series-switches/41845-192.html

        Unplug the power cord.
        Hold down the MODE button while you reconnect the power cable to the switch.
        The MODE button is on the left side of the front panel.
        Release the MODE button after the LED that is above Port 1x goes out.
        Note: The LED position can vary slightly, which depends on the model.
        You are now at the switch: prompt.

    switch: flash_init
    switch: set BAUD 115200

        $ screen -S serial /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
            Now restart screen
        
    switch: copy xmodem: flash:c3560e-universalk9-mz.152-4.E5.bin


        To start xmodem transfer with GNU screen and sx (lrzsz package):
            press Ctrl-a (screen escape sequence) followed by ':' and type
                exec !! sx c3560e-universalk9-mz.152-4.E5.bin
            NOTE: This can take up to 2 hours. 
        
    switch: boot flash:c3560e-universalk9-mz.152-4.E5.bin
