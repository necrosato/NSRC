For "Autobooting using first file form bootflash:"
    You need to update the config-register.  0x2101 will boot into the first file found.  0x2102 will use the boot system command you have set.

    conf t

    config-register 0x2102

    end

    write mem

    That will update it to use your boot system command.

ROMMON:

boot tftp://<tftp_server>/srv/tftp/<image_name>
